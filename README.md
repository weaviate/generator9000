Welcome to Generator9000! It's an open-source web app that's all about creating data objects with a twist. We use Generative AI (GPT4 from OpenAI) to not only generate data objects with specific fields but also to create images based on these data objects. 🚀

This tool is perfect if you're looking to build new, high-quality datasets for demos or Proof of Concept (PoC) projects, especially in these fast-evolving times. It's user-friendly, giving you full control over the prompts for both data and images, and other settings that directly affect the Large Language Models (LLM) you're working with.

You can tinker with all the settings, generate data objects, evaluate them, and then save your creations either on disk or in Weaviate. 📁✨

> 🔑 You can enter your OpenAI key right in the frontend. It'll be saved in your browser's local storage, making it super easy to pick up right where you left off next time you fire up the app.
